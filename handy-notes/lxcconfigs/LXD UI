## I ran this in a container on my laptop which is also running LXD but you don't have be in a container or on the same machine
## alpine/3.17

apk add npm git bash openssl haproxy
npm i -g yarn
git clone https://github.com/canonical/lxd-ui
cd lxd-ui
#rm -r keys
yarn && yarn build

vi haproxy-dev.cfg
# replace LXD_UI_BACKEND_IP with lxd core https address
# since this is in a container it can be the host's ip on the lxd bridge

# this runs the server
./entrypoint

# on the lxd server the certificate needs to be trusted 
# copy lxd-ui/keys/lxd-ui.crt to the host
# on the host run
lxc config trust add lxd-ui.crt

# then go to <whatever ip the lxd-ui is at>:8407 in browser
